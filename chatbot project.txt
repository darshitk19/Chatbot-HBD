I divided the system into two parts for customers and business owners. Business owners log in using email, with features separated by role. A simple help bot guides users on searching and adding businesses. The customer section shows recently added businesses with short, clear search results.

Difficulty that i faced in owner side if i add new business but it cannot add in recent added business in business owner side 

Also faced problem in output part when seached business in not databases it online search but not get proper details

working on that and try to improve streamlit UI
